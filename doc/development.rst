.. _scm:

--------------
Source Control
--------------

Hackersh source is controlled with Git_, the lean, mean, distributed source control machine.

The repository is publicly accessable.

    ``git clone git://github.com/ikotler/hackersh.git``

The project is hosted on `GitHub <http://github.com/ikotler/hackersh>`_.


Git Branch Structure
++++++++++++++++++++

Feature / Hotfix / Release branches follow a `Successful Git Branching Model`_. Git-flow_ is a great tool for managing the repository. I highly recommend it.

``develop``
    The "next release" branch. Likely unstable.
``master``
    Current production release (|version|) on PyPi.

Each release is tagged.

When submitting patches, please place your feature/change in its own branch prior to opening a pull reqeust on `GitHub <http://github.com/ikotler/hackersh>`_.

-----------------
Building the Docs
-----------------

Documentation is written in the powerful, flexible, and standard Python documentation format, `reStructured Text`_.
Documentation builds are powered by the powerful Pocoo project, Sphinx_. The :ref:`API Documentation <api>` is mostly documented inline throughout the module.

The Docs live in ``hackersh/doc``. In order to build them, you will first need to install Sphinx: ::

    $ pip install sphinx


Then, to build an HTML version of the docs, simply run the following from the **doc** directory: ::

    $ make html

Your ``doc/_build/html`` directory will then contain an HTML representation of the documentation, ready for publication on most web servers.

You can also generate the documentation in **epub**, **latex**, and **json**.
