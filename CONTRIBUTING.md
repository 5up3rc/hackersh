# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Hackersh. We are more than happy to accept external contributions to the project in the form of feedback, bug reports and even better - pull requests :) At this time we are primarily focusing on improving the user-experience and stability of Hackersh for our first release. Please keep this in mind if submitting feature requests, which we're happy to consider for future versions.
