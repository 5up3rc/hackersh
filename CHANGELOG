# Hackersh Changelog

HEAD

o Add `info` Command (e.g. info nmap, info ipv4_address, and etc.)

o Add `help` Command (e.g. help help, help exit, and etc.)

o And Limited auto-ocomplete for Shell-like expressions (e.g. ./<TAB> and /<TAB>)

o Automatically Handle (i.e. return False) and Log Exceptions from Components.
  To see the a given Component Exceptions use debug=True

o Support realtime STDOUT and STDERR output via debug=True (e.g. "127.0.0.1"
-> ipv4_address -> nmap(debug=True))

o Support Shell-style Arg Passing (i.e. "127.0.01" -> ipv4_address -> nmap
-p22)

o Support "Smooth" Shell Pipeline Experience (i.e. /bin/cat /etc/hosts |
/usr/bin/grep "127.0.0.1" | /usr/bin/awk '{ print $1 }' | /usr/bin/tr -d '\n'
| ipv4_address | mmap)

o Change DEAFULT_QUERY and DEFAULT_FILTER to support the new Graph Search
  Language. Example:
    'context['PROTO'] == "TCP" and context['PORT'] == "80"'
  Changed to:
    'PROTO == "TCP" and PORT == "80"'

o Context can be searched via '/' (read: div) operator
  Example:
    "127.0.0.1" -> ipv4_address -> nmap
  Then:
    _/"PORT == '80'" -> nikto
  Or:
    _/"PROTO == 'TCP'"/"PORT == '21'" -> ...
  And etc.

o Component Entry Point is changed from run() to main(). Use run() for
  external inovcation (i.e. from The Shell, or Python Code) and main() for
  internal inovcation (i.e. from another Component). The run() method will
  call the main() method, but will perform init tasks before doing so.

o Context is now a Directed Graph

o Remove RemoteSessionContext, there's only one Context Object: class Context

o Delete _ordereddict.py

Hackersh 0.2 [2013-05-02]

o Introduce `dnsdict6` - new external component for:
  Information Gathering / Network Analysis / DNS Analysis
  dnsdict6 v1.8 (c) 2011 by van Hauser / THC <vh@thc.org> www.thc.org
  Example: "hackersh.org" -> domain -> dnsdict6("-4 -s") -> ...

o Implement SimpleRegExHandler class - a new Pseudo SAX Content Handler
  class for processing output using regex

o amap, nikto, nmap, ping, w3af, xprobe2, and browse: Change DEFAULT_QUERY
  to evaluate context['IPV4_ADDRESS'] before context['HOSTNAME']

o Implement NbtScanStdoutOutputHandler class. Rewrite nbtscan to use it

o Implement SqlMapStdoutOutputHandler class. Rewrite sqlmap to use it

o Implement StdoutOutputHandler - a new Pseudo SAX Content Handler base
  class for stdout processing

o Implement ExternalComponentStreamOutput - a new base class for generic
  SAX-style output parsing. Change ExternalComponentStdoutOutput and
  ExternalComponentFileOutput to inherit from it.

o Implement shell_split() and replace shlex.split() with it. shell_split()
  will not remove double quotes (i.e. "") when splitting DEFAULT_QUERY.

o sqlmap: Change DEFAULT_QUERY to use "inline IF" to avoid:
      TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'bool' and 'str'
  Whenever:
      context['COOKIES'] = False

o Introduce `ipv6_address` - new root component for processing IPv6 Address.
  Example: "::1" -> ipv6_address -> ...

o Introduce `domain` - new root component for processing domain names.
  Example: "hackersh.org" -> domain -> ...

o Implement HackershError Exception class and add 3 new error messages:
    XXX: not enough data to start (if Component Filter is False)
    XXX: command not found (if Ext. Component filename is missing)
    XXX: unable to parse (if all Output Handlers failed)

o Split hackersh/network.py and hackersh/misc.py into multiple files and
  implement a simple plug-in architecture to load them during startup

o Add support for BackTrack 5R3 and 5R2

Hackersh 0.1 [2013-04-01]

o Initial commit
